Machine Learning introduction:
A model is a mathematical relationship derived from data that an ML system uses to make predictions
	1. Machine learning is way to enable machines to do predictions based on the dataset provided with explicitly programming them.
	2. This data allows these machines to learn from the data and become proficient by just learning from the data in similar tasks
Types of Machine Learning Techniques.
	1. Supervised learning : In this a dataset with correct values are fed to the model. The model examines the link between different data
		in the dataset to understand how the correct answer was generated. It will then use this knowledge to predict output for problems with similar nature.
		Supervise learning can be categorized into:
		Consider a weather predicton app.
		a. Regression: In this the model predicts the output as a number. Example if we use it to predict rainfall. The model will predict output in cm 1,2,3 etc.
		b. Binary Classification : Predicts output in yes/no. that is whether it will rain or not
		c. Multiclass Classification: Yeilds multiple classification from many classifications. Example, it will say rain yes/no, hail,snow etc.
